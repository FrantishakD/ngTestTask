Letâ€™s build an image search app: <br />
Records can be fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos and are stored in Salesforce <br />
Images are synchronized daily (please remember that photos removed from external API should also be removed from Salesforce) <br />
Build lightning app to display records <br />
Provide search engine to filter record based on the title <br />
Allow to send list of filtered records to email address <br />
Please provide a link to github repo with your app <br />
