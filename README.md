Letâ€™s build an image search app:
Records can be fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos and are stored in Salesforce
Images are synchronized daily (please remember that photos removed from external API should also be removed from Salesforce)
Build lightning app to display records
Provide search engine to filter record based on the title
Allow to send list of filtered records to email address
Please provide a link to github repo with your app
